## 🧠 How It Works

1. Users log in through the Windows Forms interface.
2. The system loads product and inventory data from MySQL.
3. CRUD operations interact with the database to manage products, categories, and users.
4. Billing generates invoices and updates stock quantities automatically.
5. All database interactions use structured queries to maintain data integrity.

- Implement role-based access control (admin, cashier, manager).
- Integrate barcode scanning for faster inventory management.
- Improve UI/UX with enhanced Windows Forms controls.
- Enable database backup and restore functionality.
